## Summary

The responses to the South Cambridgeshire Council's proposed plan reflect a complex landscape of opinions, with a notable division between support and opposition. Many respondents express a strong desire for sustainable development that prioritizes green spaces, affordable housing, and improved public transport. There is a consensus on the importance of maintaining the character of existing villages and protecting the green belt, with numerous calls for limited development in rural areas. Concerns about overdevelopment, particularly in the southern rural cluster and around the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, are prevalent, with many respondents fearing that unchecked growth could lead to increased congestion, loss of biodiversity, and diminished quality of life.

Supporters of the plan often highlight the need for a vibrant city district east of Milton Road, emphasizing the potential for community facilities, healthcare, and housing that meets local needs. The expansion of the Cambridge Biomedical Campus is generally viewed positively, particularly regarding its role in providing healthcare and research opportunities. However, there is a strong call for ensuring that any development is accompanied by adequate infrastructure, including transport links and local amenities.

Opposition is frequently rooted in concerns about the environmental impact of new developments, particularly regarding water supply, traffic congestion, and the preservation of green spaces. Many respondents advocate for a more cautious approach to development, suggesting that any new housing should be limited to areas with existing public transport connections and local services. The sentiment is clear: while there is a recognition of the need for growth, it must be balanced with environmental sustainability and community well-being.
