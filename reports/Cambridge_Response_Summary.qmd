## Summary

The responses to the South Cambridgeshire Council's proposed plan reflect a diverse range of opinions, with a notable emphasis on the need for sustainable development, the preservation of green spaces, and the enhancement of community facilities. Many respondents support the development of a vibrant city district east of Milton Road, contingent on the relocation of the waste water treatment plant, and the expansion of the Cambridge Biomedical Campus with additional healthcare facilities and housing. However, there is significant concern regarding the potential negative impacts of overdevelopment on local communities, biodiversity, and the character of rural villages.

A recurring theme is the call for improved public transport and cycling infrastructure to reduce car dependency and enhance accessibility. Respondents advocate for the creation of '15-minute neighbourhoods' where essential services are within walking or cycling distance, promoting a healthier lifestyle and community cohesion. There is also a strong desire for affordable housing options, particularly for key workers and families, alongside the need for diverse housing types that cater to various demographics.

Opposition to the plan often centres around the potential encroachment on green belt land and the risk of losing vital wildlife habitats. Many respondents express a preference for utilising brownfield sites for development rather than expanding into rural areas. Concerns about traffic congestion, pollution, and the adequacy of existing infrastructure to support new developments are also prevalent. Overall, while there is support for growth and development, it is tempered by a strong desire to maintain the unique character of the area and ensure that environmental considerations are at the forefront of planning decisions.
