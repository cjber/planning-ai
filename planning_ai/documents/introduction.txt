This report was produced using a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) large-language model (LLM) to produce an abstractive summary of all responses to the related planning application. This model automatically reviews every response in detail, and extracts key information to inform decision making. This document first consolidates this information into a single-page executive summary, highlighting areas of particular interest to consider, and the broad consensus of responses. Figures generated from responses then give both a geographic and statistical overview, highlighting any demographic imbalances in responses. The document then extracts detailed information from responses, grouped by theme and policy. In this section we incorporate citations which relate with the 'Summary Responses' document, to increase transparency.
