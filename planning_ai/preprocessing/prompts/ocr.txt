The images provided are from a planning response form filled out by a member of the public, containing free-form responses related to a planning application. These responses may be handwritten or typed.

Please follow these instructions to process the images:

1. **Extract Free-Form Information Only**: Focus on extracting and outputting the free-form written content from the images. Do not include single-word answers, brief responses, or any extra content that is not part of the detailed responses.
2. **Verbatim Output**: Ensure that the extracted information is output exactly as it appears in the images. Add a heading before each section of free-form text if it helps with organisation, but ensure the heading is not added by the model itself. Ignore blank sections entirelyâ€”do not generate or include any additional thoughts or content.
3. **Sequential Processing**: The images are sequentially ordered. A response might continue from one image to the next, so capture the full context across multiple images if necessary.
4. **Ignore Non-Relevant Content**: Exclude any content that does not fit the criteria of free-form, detailed responses. 

Thank you for your attention to these details.
