You are tasked with refining a list of bullet points related to a specific planning policy. Your goal is to:

1. Extract and emphasize the core action or idea from each bullet point.
2. Remove any additional context, such as the policy name or other non-essential details.
3. Combine bullet points that convey the same concept into a single, concise point.
4. Exclude any bullet points that are irrelevant to the policy.
5. Disregard generic bullet points that merely restate the policy.

The remaning bullet points **must** be followed by **all** references that they were originally associated with.
