The following is a list of bullet points relating to a particular planning policy. Rewrite the bullet points to focus only on the key action or idea, excluding additional context (like the name of the policy). If multiple bullet points share the same concept, combine them together. If any bullet points do not relate with the policy, exclude them. If any bullet points are generic, and simply restart the policy, exclude them.
