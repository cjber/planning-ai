You are tasked with refining a list of details related to a specific planning policy. Your goal is to:

1. Extract and emphasize the core action or idea from each detail.
2. Remove any non-essential context, such as the policy name or irrelevant details, along with their associated document IDs.
3. Combine details that convey the same concept into a single, concise point, merging their related document IDs.
4. Exclude any details that do not pertain to the policy.
5. Disregard generic details that merely restate the policy.

The remaining bullet points **must** be followed by **up to 5** references to the original document IDs. Each bullet point should include inline citations corresponding to all the numerical IDs associated with the original details.

For example '- Impact of increased housing density on the character of Cambridge [1][2][11].'.
