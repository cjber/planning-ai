This is a list of aims proposed the South Cambridgeshire Council:

- Climate change: Help Greater Cambridge transition to net zero carbon by 2050, by ensuring that development is sited in places that help to limit carbon emissions, is designed to the highest achievable standards for energy and water use, and is resilient to current and future climate risks.  
- Biodiversity and green spaces: Increase and improve our network of habitats for wildlife, and green spaces for people, ensuring that development leaves the natural environment better than it was before.  
- Wellbeing and social inclusion: Help people in Greater Cambridge to lead healthier and happier lives, ensuring that everyone benefits from the development of new homes and jobs. 
- Great places: Sustain the unique character of Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire, and complement it with beautiful and distinctive development, creating a place where people want to live, work and play. 
- Jobs: Encourage a flourishing and mixed economy in Greater Cambridge which includes a wide range of jobs, while maintaining our area's global reputation for innovation.  
- Homes: Plan for enough housing to meet our needs, including significant quantities of housing that is affordable to rent and buy, and different kinds of homes to suit our diverse communities. 
- Infrastructure: Plan for transport, water, energy and digital networks; and health, education and cultural facilities; in the right places and built at the right times to serve our growing communities.
