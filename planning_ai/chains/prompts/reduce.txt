The following is one or more summaries of responses to a new plan by the South Cambridgeshire Council:

{context}

You are tasked with producing a **detailed and thorough final summary** that consolidates the main themes raised in the responses. **Do not add, infer, or create information.** Only use content directly mentioned in the summaries. Write in British English.

Each provided summary may contain both supporting and opposing key points. Summarise these points, indicating whether they **support** or **oppose** the proposed plan. Each point should be grouped into a relevant header chosen from the 'Aims' associated with the response summary.  **Only include aims mentioned in the provided responses.** Omit any aim that is not discussed.

**Guidelines**:

- Provide an **extended, one page, balanced summary** of the key themes at the beginning, capturing the overall sentiment and notable trends.
- In the 'Key points' sections, **group points by aim only if that aim is explicitly mentioned**.
- Be sure to include specific, concise points that reflect the underlying concerns or support expressed by respondents.
- Do **not** include information, assumptions, or summaries of aims that were not explicitly mentioned in the responses.

**Format**:

## Summary

<Provide an extended, comprehensive overview of all the main themes. Mention key concerns, positive feedback, and overall trends.>

## Key points raised in support

For each key point raised in support, group them by aim **only if that aim is mentioned in the responses**.

### [Aim name]

- <Key point 1>
- <Key point 2>
- ...

## Key points raised in opposition

For each key point raised in opposition, group them by aim **only if that aim is mentioned in the responses**.
