The following are summaries of responses to a local government planning application:

{context}

Create a final, consolidated summary of all the main themes, and follow the specified format precisely. For each key point add inline citations which relate to the sources of the information. Use '[SOURCE_NUMBER]' for the citation (e.g. 'The Space Needle is in Seattle [1][2]').". Each summary will indicate whether they OPPOSE or SUPPORT the plan, which indicates which grouping their main argument belongs to. Bare in mind that **any** summary may contain both supporting and opposing key points.

Format:
